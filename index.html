            <p class="para1">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam  15 October 1931 – 27
                July 2015 was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India
                from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
                engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
                was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
                efforts.<br> <br>He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
                ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,
                technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
                nuclear test by India in 1974<br>

                <br>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
                Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
                "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a
                single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's
                highest civilian honour.

                While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from
                an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
                attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state
                honours.

            <p class="para2">Kalam received several honours during his lifetime. In 1981, he was granted the “Padma Bhusan,” the Republic of India’s third-highest civilian honour. Then, in 1990, he was granted the Padma Vibhushan, the Republic of India’s second-highest civilian honour.<br>

               <br> In 1997, the Indian government awarded Abdul Kalam the “Bharat Ratna,” the Republic of India’s highest civilian honour, in addition to the “Indira Gandhi Award of National Integration” even by “Indian National Congress,” which is named after former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The following year, in 1998, he was given the “Veer Savarkar Award.” The SASTRA “Ramanujan Award” was bestowed to him in 2000. In 2007, he was awarded the “King Charles II Medal” by the United Kingdom for his contributions to scientific advancements in India.

            <h2 class="head3">APJ Abdul Kalam as a Scientist</h2>
            <p class="para3">On graduation from the University of Madras in 1960, APJ Abdul Kalam returned to the Defence Research and Development organisation Organisation as a scientist (DRDO). He began his career by creating a tiny hovercraft, however his position with the DRDO did not persuade him. APJ Abdul Kalam was moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969 as the project head of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle, which successfully launched the Rohini satellite into relatively near orbit in July 1980.<br>

                <br>Raja Ramanna also invited APJ Abdul Kalam to see the country’s first nuclear test, Laughing Buddha, as the spokesman of TBRL. However, he had never participated in its development.</p>

            <h2 class="head4">Presidency</h2>
            <p class="para4">Sir Kalam was the rightful 11th Indian President. His presidency lasted from July 25, 2002, to July 25, 2007. He was elected with a huge margin of victory in a presidential election in 2002. The National Democratic Alliances’ nomination for President was endorsed by the Samajwadi Party and the National Congress Party. He was often referred to as the people’s President because of his numerous contributions to the well-being of the people and the country.<br><br> He was daring and brave enough to make and implement difficult, delicate, or contentious judgments. Perhaps the most difficult Act he had to sign was the “office of profit.” Under the English Settlement Act of 1701 in 1701, the “office of profit” indicates that no one individual who is a professional setup process underneath the royal family or who has any arrangement with or is receiving a pension from the prince does have the ability to work for the “House of Commons.” This will give the royal family no influence on administrative conditions.</p>

        <div class="page6">
            <h2 class="head6">Books he wrote</h2>
            <p class="para6">In his lifetime, he published several works, including Agni ki Udaan (1999), India 2020 (1998), Ignited Minds (2002), Naa Jeevana Gamanam (2013), Turning Points: A Journey Across Difficulties (2012), Indominate Spirit (2006), and You Are Born To Blossom (2007).

            <h2 class="head7">Death:</h2>
            <p class="para7">Shillong, Meghalaya, on July 27, 2015.

                The day we left a man who desired a miracle for India’s youth was a bad day for India. He falls inside the lecture hall only 5 minutes into it, about 6:35 p.m. In critical condition, he was brought to ‘Bethany Hospital.’ He was maintained in the intensive-care unit but showed no signs of life, and he was certified dead at 7:45 p.m. because of cardiac arrest.<br>
                
                <br>APJ Abdul Kalam is a very kind-hearted individual who generously performed many things for India. He is indeed the reason we have nuclear weapons today. He not only became President & did a lot of good for India, but he also made a significant contribution to missile history.</p>
